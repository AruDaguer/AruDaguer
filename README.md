I'm Laura Daguer, a student in Computer Science at the Federal Institute of SÃ£o Paulo (IFSP), currently based in SÃ£o Paulo. I'm focused on expanding my knowledge, especially in Python and HTML, with future plans to explore PHP. I'm interested in the user experience (UX) area. Outside of studies, I enjoy dancing, playing music, participating in theater, and reading. I've completed projects like "Elixir Maker," "RPG character sheet manager," and "ATOM" (a Sumo robot), all in 2023, along with "Stock Exchange Trading Simulator" and "GI360," a finance information website.
